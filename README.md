# Airbnb-Analysis
## Problem Statement:
 To analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.
## Approach to this Project:
## MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:
 Establish a connection to the
MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset. Perform queries and
data retrieval operations to extract the necessary information for your analysis.
## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
  Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling
missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as
necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data
integrity and consistency.
## Geospatial Visualization: 
  Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes
the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps.
Visualize the distribution of listings across different locations, allowing users to
explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.
## Interactive Visualizations:
  Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations
that allow users to filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences.
Enable users to interact with the visualizations to explore specific regions,
property types, or time periods of interest.
## Dashboard Creation:
  Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a
comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from your analysis.
Combine different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to provide a
holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.
